# TableFormEditing

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

The project is created from the scratch and only used Bootstrap and Fontawesome libraries. Bootstrap is a populer CSS Framework and its components and styles are very useful in terms of UI/UX. It has color theme, which makes UI consistent; default classes and components and in that way we don't need to create classes most of time and also create components with custom classes. Bootstrap provides all in a consistent manner.

Fontawesome is a very popular icon library and we can use a lot of features like masking, stacking and rotating; and also consistent like Bootstrap and using Bootstrap and Fontawesome together makes UI perfect.

I did not used any big library based on Bootstap. There are also a lot of component libraries for Angular that have many components design to use easily in Angular. If I was using a big library for Fontawesome like ng-bootstrap, I would use its modal service to open modal and the modal would be a seperate component. I could also include ngx-datatable to be used in the main table which has capability of filtering, sorting etc.
